## Enhanced Gigaflow Virtual Switch (GVS)

The core contribution of this project is the extension of the Gigaflow Virtual Switch to support hardware acceleration through SmartNIC offload. The enhanced GVS maintains full backward compatibility with the software-only implementation while adding comprehensive hardware acceleration capabilities.

### Architecture and Design

The enhanced GVS implements a hybrid software-hardware architecture where the Gigaflow cache can operate in three distinct modes:

1. **Software-only Mode**: Traditional CPU-based packet processing with the original Gigaflow cache implementation
2. **Hardware-assisted Mode**: Critical path operations offloaded to SmartNIC while maintaining software control plane
3. **Full Hardware Mode**: Complete pipeline execution on SmartNIC with minimal CPU involvement

### Hardware Integration Layer

The hardware integration layer provides a unified abstraction for different SmartNIC platforms. The implementation includes:

**SDNet Driver Integration**: The enhanced GVS integrates with Xilinx's SDNet IP through custom drivers that handle rule installation, table updates, and statistics collection. The SDNet files included in the project are auto-generated when the bitstream is created through the Vivado software compilation process.

**Rule Translation Engine**: Converts high-level Gigaflow cache policies into hardware-compatible table entries and match-action rules that can be programmed into the P4 pipeline.

**Flow State Synchronization**: Maintains consistency between software and hardware flow tables, ensuring seamless failover and load balancing between processing domains.

**Performance Monitoring**: Real-time collection of hardware performance metrics including throughput, latency, cache hit rates, and resource utilization.

### P4 Pipeline Implementation

The hardware pipeline implements the complete Gigaflow cache logic in P4, including:

- **Multi-stage Cache Lookup**: Hierarchical cache structure with L1 and L2 lookup stages
- **Adaptive Replacement Policy**: Hardware implementation of cache replacement algorithms including LRU and frequency-based eviction
- **Flow Classification**: High-speed packet classification using ternary and exact match tables
- **Statistics Collection**: Per-flow and aggregate statistics maintained in hardware registers

### Enhanced Features

**Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Runtime modification of cache policies and table sizes without pipeline restart
**Multi-tenant Support**: Isolated cache domains for different virtual networks or tenants  
**Telemetry Integration**: Export of detailed flow and performance data to monitoring systems
**Fault Tolerance**: Automatic failover to software processing when hardware resources are exhausted

### Integration with Open vSwitch

The enhanced GVS maintains full compatibility with OVS through the existing datapath interface while extending it with hardware acceleration hooks. The integration supports:

- Standard OpenFlow protocol for rule installation
- OVS userspace utilities and management tools  
- Existing OVS-based orchestration platforms (OpenStack, Kubernetes)
- Custom extensions for hardware-specific optimizations
